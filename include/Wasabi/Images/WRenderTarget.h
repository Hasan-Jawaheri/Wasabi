/** @file WRenderTarget.h
 *  @brief Render targets implementation
 *
 *  Render targets are special images that can be used to render a scene to. A
 *  render target enable one to perform render-to-texture operations that are
 *  required for many applications such as post-processing effects.
 *  Rendering to render targets is done by calling WRenderTarget::Begin(), rendering
 *  assets (objects, sprites, etc...) and then calling WRenderTarget::End(). Notice
 *  that after ending, the render target merely creates a "command buffer" filled
 *  with the recorded rendering commands that occurred between Begin() and End(). To
 *  actually perform the rendering stored in the buffer, either call
 *  WRenderTarget::End() passing true (default) or explicitly call
 *  WRenderTarget::Submit() afterwards.
 *
 *  @author Hasan Al-Jawaheri (hbj)
 *  @bug No known bugs.
