 * * Point: This is light that is illuminated from a point (the position of the
 * 	 WLight's WOrientation base class) whose range is specified by SetRange().
 * 	 This is suitable for light bulbs or flame torches etc...
 * * Spot: This is light that is illuminated from a point (the position of the
 * 	 WLight's WOrientation base class) pointing at a direction (the L vector
 * 	 of the WLight's WOrientation base class) in a cone shape whose height (
 * 	 or length) is specified by SetRange() and whose emission angle is
 * 	 specified by SetEmittingAngle(). This is suitable for car headlights,
